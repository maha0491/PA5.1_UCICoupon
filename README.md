By utilizing the cleaned version of the UCI Coupon Data, it was calculated that the proportion of total observations who chose to accept the coupon is 0.569.

With regards to specifically Bar coupons, it was calculated that the proportion of Bar Coupons that were accepted is about 0.412.

With further analysis, it is derived that those who go to a bar 4 or more times a month are the most likely to accept a coupon (with an acceptance rate of about 76.2%), in comparison to those who go 3 or fewer times a month (with an acceptance rate of about 37.2%).

When analyzing frequency of visits and age, drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are over the age of 25 are more likely to accept the coupons (with an acceptance rate of about 69.0%), in comparison with those who go less then once a month or are less than 25 years of age (with an acceptance rate of about 33.8%).

Additionally, drivers who go to a bar more than once a month, with passengers that are not a kid and had occupations other than Farming, Fishing or Forestry are more likely to accept coupons (with an acceptance rate of 70.9%) vs. those who go to the bar less than once a month or have passengers that are kids or have an occupation in Farming, Fishing or Forestry (with an acceptance rate of 29.8%).

Finally, we can observe that drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are under the age of 30 are willing to accept coupons (with an acceptance rate of about 72.0%), in comparison with drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had passengers who are not a kid and were not widowed (with an acceptance rate of 71.4%). Both these groups are more likely to accept bar coupons versus those who go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K who are willing to accept bar coupons (with an acceptance rate of about 55.6%).

### Based on this information, one can hypothesize that it would be highly recommended to promote the bar coupons to predominantly drivers who go to a bar 4 or more times a month. In addition, if a customer visits a bar more than once a month, it is recommended that coupons are geared more towards customers who are under 30 or those whose passengers are not kids and are not widowed. These customers are generally more likely to utilize the coupon upon its receipt.

With regards to specifically More Expensive Restaurants, it was calculated that the proportion of More Expensive Restaurants Coupons that were accepted is about 0.446.

With further analysis, it is derived that drivers who went to a more expensive restaurant, with a price of  20ùë°ùëú
 50, 4 or more times a month are more likely to accept the coupon (with an acceptance rate of about 64.7%). In contrast, drivers who went to a more expensive restaurant 3 or fewer times a month are less likely to accept a coupon (with an acceptance rate of about 42.8%).

When analyzing the data based on frequency of visits and gender, it was calculated that drivers who go to a more expensive restaurant more than once a month and are Female are more likely to accept a coupon (with an acceptance rate of about 51.9%) in comparison with those who may go to a more expensive restaurant less than once a month or are not Female (with an acceptance rate of about 43.1%).

With the analysis of number of visits a month, if a driver's passenger is a child and based on their Marital status, it is derived that drivers who go to a more expensive restaurant more than once a month and are male and single are more likely to accept a coupon (with an acceptance rate of about 61%). Drivers who go to a more expensive restaurant less than once a month, or are not male, or are not single are less likely to accept a coupon (with an acceptance rate of about 43.4%.

### Based on this data, it can be hypothesized that drivers who go to more expensive restaurants 4 or more times are ideally ones who will accept coupons. Additionally, it can be hypothesized that customers who go to expensive restaurants more than once a month and are Female as well as customers who go to more expensive restaurants more than once a month and are Single Males are ones who are more likely to accept coupons if they were sent to their cell phones.
